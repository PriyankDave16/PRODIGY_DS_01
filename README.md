# PRODIGY_DS_01
# Population Data Visualization

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Untitled.ipynb`) for visualizing population data. The project uses popular Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating informative visualizations.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to explore and visualize population trends and characteristics. It is designed to be a starting point for anyone interested in analyzing demographic data using Python.

## Features

* **Data Loading:** Reads population data from a CSV file (`population.csv`).
* **Data Manipulation:** Utilizes Pandas for efficient data handling.
* **Visualization:** Employs Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate various plots and charts to represent population data.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn

## Setup and Installation

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git)
    cd YourRepositoryName
    ```
    (Replace `YourUsername` and `YourRepositoryName` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.)

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
    ```

4.  **Obtain the data:**
    This project expects a CSV file named `population.csv` to be present in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook. You will need to provide your own `population.csv` file. The current notebook shows a `FileNotFoundError`, indicating that this file is missing.

    **Example `population.csv` format (adjust as per your data):**
    ```csv
    Year,Country,Population
    2000,USA,282000000
    2000,Canada,30700000
    2001,USA,285000000
    2001,Canada,31000000
    ```

5.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Untitled.ipynb
    ```
    This command will open the Jupyter Notebook in your web browser, where you can run the cells and see the visualizations.

## Usage

Once you have the Jupyter Notebook open, you can run each cell sequentially to:
1.  Import necessary libraries.
2.  Load the `population.csv` data into a pandas DataFrame.
3.  Perform data analysis and generate visualizations.

You can modify the code in the notebook to explore different aspects of the population data or create new visualizations.
